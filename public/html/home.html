        <p>
          Our mission is to create a supportive hiking community for
          individuals who have experienced incarceration or
          addiction, offering a safe and healing space to reconnect
          with
          nature, rebuild self-worth, and foster meaningful
          connections. Through shared journeys on the trail, we aim to
          inspire growth, resilience, and hope for a healthier,
          purpose-driven future.
